I got sunburnt waiting for the jets to land
为了等待飞机降落我已晒成了黑炭
Circus people with hairy little hands
那些广场上有着毛茸茸小手的人们
Come on boys strike up the army band
快来奏起军乐队吧
I got sunburnt waiting for the jets
为了等待飞机降落我已晒成了黑炭
How do you feel?
你觉得怎么样?
How do you feel?
你觉得怎么样?
I can't seem to see through solid marble eyes
我无法看穿那冰冷凝固的双眸
Fiery pianos wash up on a foggy coast
燃烧着的钢琴洗去了海边的雾
Squeaky old organs have given up the ghost
吱吱作响的旧零件已经报废了
Fire them up and kill the piano birds
点燃了它就毁灭了善鸣的琴鸟
There's creaky old organs burning on the coast
嘎吱作响的旧零件在海边燃烧
How do you feel?
你觉得怎么样?
How do you feel?
你觉得怎么样?
I can't seem to breath with a rusted metal heart
我无法用锈蚀的金属心脏呼吸
I can't seem to see through solid marble eyes
