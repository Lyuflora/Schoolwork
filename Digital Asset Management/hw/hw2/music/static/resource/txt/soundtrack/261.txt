Moon Without The Stars 
专辑：古树旋律 Deemo
歌手：Quiana

Can't imagine life without having you here by my side
无法想象没有你的生活，愿你永在身边
No matter the cost
无论何许代价
When you just can hold on and the wind is too strong
当你遭遇坎坷，逆风而行
I'll be there to break the fall
我将是你坚强的后盾
 

When you feel confused by the world and all its mysteries
神秘莫测的世界令你不知所措
I can only hope you'll remember all the simple things
但我希望世间纯真长存你心
 

Life was a heartbeat without heartache
脉搏戛然而止
was a hurricane without the rain
雨落无风相随
was the moon without the stars
明月无星陪伴
That's how it feels when we're apart
这就是我离开你以后的生活
was a heartbeat without heartache
脉搏戛然而止
 

was a hurricane without the rain
雨落无风相随
was the moon without the stars
明月无星陪伴
That's how it feels when we're apart
这就是我离开你以后的生活
 

But if it was easy as turning back the hands of time
即使时光轻易倒流
I wanna change a thing
我将不变分毫
And I just wanna let you know I'll never let you go
只想告诉你我永不放手
Belong is being a part of me
你永远是我生命的一部分
 

When you feel confused by the world and all its mysteries
神秘莫测的世界令你不知所措
I can only hope you'll remember all the simple things
但我希望世间纯真长存你心
 

Life was a heartbeat without heartache
脉搏戛然而止
was a hurricane without the rain
雨落无风相随
was the moon without the stars
明月无星陪伴
That's how it feels when we're apart
这就是我离开你以后的生活
 

was a heartbeat without heartache
脉搏戛然而止
was a hurricane without the rain
雨落无风相随
was the moon without the stars
明月无星陪伴
That's how it feels when we're apart
这就是我离开你以后的生活
 

So complete, so complete
只有你的存在
You're all I ever need
我的生命才得以如此完整
You're here with me right now
而如今，此时此刻
Right here in my heart now
你就在我心中
was a heartbeat without heartache
脉搏戛然而止
was a hurricane without the rain
雨落无风相随
was the moon without the stars
明月无星陪伴
That's how it feels when we're apart
这就是我离开你以后的生活
Life was a heartbeat without heartache
脉搏戛然而止
was a hurricane without the rain
雨落无风相随
was the moon without the stars
明月无星陪伴
That's how it feels when we're apart
这就是我离开你以后的生活
was a heartbeat without heartache
脉搏戛然而止
was a hurricane without the rain
雨落无风相随
was the moon without the stars
明月无星陪伴
That's how it feels when we're apart
这就是我离开你以后的生活
