I know that it is freezing, but I think we have to walk
我知道外面天寒地冻，但我们得继续前行。
I keep waving at the taxis, they keep turning their lights off
我挥手叫的士，他们关掉大灯呼啸而过。
But Julie knows a party at some actor's West side loft
但茱莉知道一个艺人家西阁楼的派对
Supplies are endless in the evening by the morning they'll be gone
补给在夜晚永无穷尽却在早晨毫无踪影
When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
当一切孤独我能成为自己的挚友
I'll get a coffee and the paper, have my own conversations
我会得到咖啡和报纸，还有我的自言自语
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
伴着人行道、和平鸽还有橱窗上的倒影
The mask I polish in the evening by the morning looks like ****
我夜晚擦亮的面罩如狗屎般糟糕
And I know you have a heavy heart, I can feel it when we kiss
当我们拥吻，我能感受到你沉重的爱
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
许多比我强壮的男人企图伸出臂膀举起它
But me I'm not a gambler, you can count on me to split
你可以指望我离开，但是我并非赌徒
The love I sell you in the evening by the morning won't exist
夜晚给你的爱到早晨就消失殆尽
You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
你耀眼明星般的眼睛尽显黑暗
Just keep going to the bathroom, always say you'll be right back
头也不回地跑向盥洗室嘴里却说马上就回
Well, it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad
好吧，这可以了解彼此，孩子，你得到了惩罚
What's so easy in the evening by the morning's such a drag
在黑夜是如此的轻松到了早晨却步履蹒跚
I got a flask inside my pocket, we can share it on the train
我口袋有瓶酒，我们可以在火车上共享
And if you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
若你承诺保持清醒，我会追随你
We may die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
我们也许会死于药物，但是我们战胜了所有痛苦
But what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane
但是在夜晚极其普通到了早晨却极致疯狂
And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
我不确定是否所有的麻烦都起因于此
The reasons all have run away, but the feeling never did
所有理由不翼而飞，但是感受一直都在
It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
我不会推荐什么，但是只有一条出路
'Cause what is simple in the moonlight by the morning never is
因为那在月光下如此简单到了早晨却与之相反
And what's so simple in the moonlight now it's so complicated
在月光下是如此简洁现在却让人绞尽脑汁
And what's so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight
在月光下是如此简洁现在却无从下手
So simple in the moonlight
