歌手：Lyn

You try to run me through hold on
你试图逃离这里么 站住
Think again don't you know what you're starting
烦请三思 你也不知道你招惹的是谁
But...you sure ain't got a clue how bad
不过 你应该还没搞清接下来要发生的血雨腥风
This will go don't you know know my art
难道你还不明白我的美学吗
(Art of war)
（战争的美学）
And as you look to the horizon not a cloud
你抬头望向远方 此时万里无云
But then stormy weather's caught you cold
但暴风雨的到来马上会让你措手不及
Seems like it crept up out of nowhere all around
一切发生地似乎毫无征兆
You it's not quite what you foretold
凡事并不能都如你所愿
You'll never see it coming
你永远预测不到它的到来
You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
你将见证我的思绪雷厉风行
You're done in
你的末日已至
By the time it's hit you, your last surprise
击中的那一刻 便是赠与你的最后一份惊喜
Ooooh
哦
You think you got your game planned out
你以为你的计划已经万无一失
To a T Yet I'm two steps ahead yeah
然而我早已领先甚远
So...you step into my way stand down
于是你放松警惕 试图拦住我的去路
It's a trap one more step and you're dead
然而这只是我设下的陷阱 多踏一步便万劫不复
(Yeah you're dead)
（你已穷途末路）
Why just a picosecond ago clear blue skies
为何刚刚还晴空万里
But now lightning's struck your last resolve
转眼间便雷声大作 吞没你的决意
It's not an accident that no one hears your cries
这一切并非巧合 无人能听到你的呼救
As your last strength seems to dissolve
你最后的力量也将分崩离析
You'll never see it coming
你永远预测不到它的到来
You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
你将见证我的思绪雷厉风行
You're done in
你的末日已至
By the time it's hit you, your last surprise
击中的那一刻 便是赠与你的最后一份惊喜
I'm coming for you
我正是冲你而来
My game's always so fast, so fine
我的演出永远完美无缺
You're spun in
你惊觉大事不妙
By the net you didn't catch it in time
落入陷阱之中 你已无法追赶上我
Ooooh
哦
Better think about your game
最好再重新考虑你的计划
Are you sure your next move's the right one for you
你确定你的下一步已万无一失了吗
Are you sure you won't get outmaneuvered
你确定你不会再被我智取
Again and again my friend
从而无数次重蹈覆辙吗 朋友
You'll never see it coming
你永远预测不到它的到来
You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
你将见证我的思绪雷厉风行
You're done in
你的末日已至
By the time it's hit you, your last surprise

My game's always so fast, so fine
我的演出永远完美无缺
You're spun in
你惊觉大事不妙
By the net you didn't catch it in time
落入陷阱之中 你已无法追赶上我
Ooooh
