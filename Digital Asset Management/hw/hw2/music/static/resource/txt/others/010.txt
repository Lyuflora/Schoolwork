jesus jesus can you tell me what the problem is
上帝 上帝啊你能否告诉我问题出在了哪儿
with the world and all the people in it
在这个拥挤不堪的世界里
because i've been hearing stories about the end of the world
因为我早已知晓故事中这世界的尽头
but i'm love with a girl and i don't want to leave her
但我却万般无法离开我心上的女孩啊
and the television screams
电视屏幕迷离地闪烁着
such hideous things
内容如此令人惊骇
and they're talking about the war on the radio
他们都在谈论着广播上所说的战争
they say the whole things gonna blow
他们说一切的一切都将灰飞烟灭
and we will all be left alone
我们都将悄然逝去
no we'll be dead and we won't know what hit us
根本不知道是什么毁灭了我们
jesus jesus if you're up there won't you hear me
上帝 上帝啊如果你在那儿为何就不听听我的建议
'cause i've been wondering if you're listening for quite a while
因为我不清楚你是否真的愿意接受忠告
jesus jesus it's such a pretty place we live in
上帝 上帝啊我们生活的世界是如此美妙
and i know we've ****** it up but please be kind
我知道我们搞砸了 但愿你能宽恕
don't let us go out like the dinosaurs
不要让我们像恐龙一样只留下化石
or blown to bits in a third world war
亦或是在另一场世界大战中尸骨无存
there are a hundred different things i'd like to do
我仍有许多未完成的心愿
i'd like to climb to the top of the eiffel tower
我想攀上那高耸的埃菲尔铁塔
look up from the ground at a meteor shower
仰望天空绚丽的流星雨
and maybe even raise a family
甚至能有个属于自己的家
jesus jesus there are those who say they love you
上帝 上帝啊那些亲口说爱你的人
but they have treated me so goddamn mean
他们对我却如此的尖酸刻薄
and i know you said forgive them
你曾经和蔼地说 还是原谅他们吧
for they know not what they do
他们不知道自己做了些什么
but sometimes i think they do
其实他们知道自己的行径
and i think about you
而我深深的想着你
and if all the heathens burn in hell
如果让所有的异教徒在地狱的烈火中苦苦挣扎
do all their children burn as well
同样他们的孩子也随之化为灰烬
what about the muslims and the gays and the unwed mothers
那***、同性恋和未婚的母亲呢
and what about me and all my friends
那我和我所有的朋友们呢
are we all sinner if we sin
我们是否都会因为犯下过错成为罪人
does it even matter in the end
假设我们如此不幸
if we're unhappy
在世界的尽头这一切都重要吗
jesus jesus i'm still looking for answers
上帝 上帝啊我仍在寻找着答案
though i know that i won't find them here tonight
尽管今晚我知道我根本找不到他们
but jesus juses could you call me if you have the time
但是上帝 上帝啊我在随时等待你的呼唤
maybe we could meet for coffee and work it out
也许我们能促膝谈心
maybe then i'd understand what it's all about
