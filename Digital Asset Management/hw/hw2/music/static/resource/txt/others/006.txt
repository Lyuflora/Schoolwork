Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
草莓樱桃加上一个天使的香吻饱含了春天清新的气息
My summer wine is really made from all these things
我的夏日美酒也飘散着这些美好事物的醇香
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
我脚踏银色马刺奔涌在这小镇上
A song that I had only sang to just a few
欢快地唱起了一首我最爱的歌谣
She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time
她看到了我闪亮的银色马刺说想和我一起奔向远方
And I will give to you summer wine
让我们共饮夏日的美酒
Ohh-oh-oh summer wine
噢，多么醇香浓郁的夏日美酒
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring

Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time

And I will give to you summer wine
让我们共饮夏日的美酒
Ohhh-oh summer wine
噢，多么醇香浓郁的夏日美酒
My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
这暖风吹得人心醉，我闭上双眼说不出话
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
懒洋洋地躺在那里任凭微风去荡漾
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
她用自己的方式让我放心去感受这惬意
And then she gave to me more summer wine
让我饮了更多的夏日美酒
Mmm-mm summer wine
噢，多么醇香浓郁的夏日美酒

When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes
炎炎的夏日照醒了双眼迷蒙的我
My silver spurs were gone my head felt twice its size
我头都大了我的银色马刺不见了
She took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
她拿走了我的银色马刺和一美元十美分
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
只留下我对夏日美酒深深的渴望
