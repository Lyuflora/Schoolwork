Bricks 
专辑：Just Love
歌手：Us The Duo

Don't wanna get locked away
不想被囚禁
In a neighborhood I can't escape
在这穷途末路
The more years that go by
年年岁岁
The harder it is to leave
逃离 却愈发遥不可及
Don't wanna get locked inside
不愿被禁锢
Up follow and life
上碧落下黄泉 无处可逃
I can't be who I am when
我不再是我
No one understands me
当无人知我
But you do you always did
但你懂 一如往昔
You do you always did
真好 有你懂我
Bricks I'm imprisoned by expensive white fences
昂贵的白色栅栏将我拘禁
But my senses tell me your kiss
但我全身的细胞都在叫嚣
Is enough to satisfy my intentions
是你的吻 叫我餍足
But I'm buried in these bricks
砖瓦之下乃我埋骨之处
Don't wanna drown in a sea
不欲溺亡
Of black and white TV's
在黑白画面的浪潮中
There's so much color hiding
无它 色彩
Right behind the small screen
小小屏幕之后
Don't wanna get trapped inside
无意被困
A typical nine to five
朝九晚五一族
Breathing recycled air
呼吸着再循环的空气
Where no one understands me
无人知我
But you do you always did
但你懂 一如昨日
You do you always did
真好 有你懂
Bricks I'm imprisoned by expensive white fences
昂贵的白色栅栏将我拘禁
But my senses tell me your kiss
但我全身的血液都在叫嚣
Is enough to satisfy my intentions
是你的吻 叫我餍足
But I'm buried in these bricks
砖瓦之下乃我埋骨之处
But you do you always did
但你懂 一如从前
You do you always did
真好 有你懂
Bricks I'm imprisoned by expensive white fences
昂贵的白色栅栏将我拘禁
But my senses tell me your kiss
但我全身的感官都在叫嚣
Is enough to satisfy my intentions
是你的吻 叫我餍足
But I'm buried in these bricks
砖瓦之下乃我埋骨之处
I'm buried in these bricks
砖瓦之下乃我埋骨之处
I'm buried in these bricks
