set your eyes love

set your eyes

oh west against the morning

'cause i had no warning of this

when they come to wake me up

set your sights love

set your sights

oh far across the ocean

'cause if i never touched to ocean

i would only come back home to sleep

but oh my sight

am i alright

am i alright

cut your ties love

cut your ties

and say i never knew you

but they'll see right through you

and you cannot run and hide

but keep the faith love

keep the faith

though i know it's gonna bring you

i know it's gonna bring you down

but though the devil may not take you

you never will escape this love

but oh my sight

am i alright

am i alright

but still this burning in my throat

is going through all of the motions

and i will someday come to my home

and maybe one day i will reach the ocean
